\section{Trusted Computing}

Trusted Computing (TC) is the notion of embedding security into the hardware,
making it readily available on commodity devices.
The notion originated in the Trusted Computing Group\footnote{\url{https://trustedcomputinggroup.org}}.
The original goal of TC was the development of Trusted Platform Modules (hardware/firmware)
and more recently Trusted Network Connect (TNC) a protocol specification for secure network connections
with authentication, authorization and accountability.

Some general features present in TC are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Secure Boot} - which allows the system to boot into a defined and trusted configuration.
    \item \textbf{Curtained Memory} - provides strong memory isolation (i.e. memory that cannot be read by other processes).
    \item \textbf{Sealed Storage} - Allows software to keep cryptographically secure secrets.
    \item \textbf{Secure I/O} - Thwarts attacks like keyloggers and screen scrapers.
    \item \textbf{Integrity Measurements} - Ability to compute hashes of executable code,
    configuration data, and other system state information.
    \item \textbf{Remote Attestation} - Allows a trusted device to present reliable evidence to remote parties of the about the running software.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Software Attestation}
Software attestation can be divided into local and remote attestation.
Local attestation is the ability of a program to authenticate itself.
Remote attestation is the ability of a system to make reliable statements about the software it is running in another system.

\subsection{Trusted Platform Module}
A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is hardware designed according to the ISO/IEC 11889 standard.
It is a chip built into a dedicated microcontroller which can be used as a secure cryptographic processor.

\subsubsection{Issues}
The has been some resistance and criticism over the generalized adoption of TPMs such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rise of privacy concerns.
    \item Physical/Administrative access to hardware bases.
    \item The private endorsement key is fundamental to the security of the TPM circuit,
    this key is never made available to the end-user, requiring users to trust the manufacturer.
    \item Rigidity and lack of relevant trusted functions for specific deployments.
    \item The performance of TPMs is lackluster.
    Vendors have little incentive to use faster (and more expensive) parts.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Services}
TPMs provide three basic services, authenticated boot, attestation and encryption facilities.

\paragraph{Authentication}
Provides mean to unequivocally identify the TPM module and platform.
Each TPM has a embedded key pair, the \textit{Endorsement Key}.
This key is signed by the manufacturer as to guarantee the correctness the chip and validity of the key.

\paragraph{Trusted Boot}
The function responsible for booting the OS in stages,
ensuring that each portion of the OS is trusted and approved for use.
A TC-enabled system using TPM devices maintains a list of appropriate HW and SW components for verification of the boot process.

\paragraph{Authenticated Boot}
Responsible for booting the entire OS in successive stages,
assuming that each portion of the OS loaded is a version that is approved for use.
At each stage the digital signature associated with the software is verified and loaded and
the tamper evidence log of the entire boot process is registered to detect any tampering with the log.

\paragraph{Platform Configuration Registers}
PCRs are special registers which are primarily used to store fingerprints of a portion of the software booting on a computer,
they are guaranteed to be reset upon a computer boot.

\paragraph{Extended Authenticated Configurations}
From the base functions it is possible to expand the trust-boundary to include new hardware devices,
software utilities, stack layers or applications.

\paragraph{Certification Service}
Once a configuration is achieved and logged the TPM can certify the configuration to others, producing a digital certificate.
There is confidence that the configuration is unaltered because the TPM is considered to be trustworthy and only the TPM possesses the TPM private key.

\paragraph{Remote Attestation Protocol}
Aims to provide a remote entity with means to assess the security if the contacted platform.
Allows to retrieve from the TPM a signature called \textit{quote} that tells the resulting platform configuration,
built through the attested platform boot, by the loaded firmware and software.

\paragraph{Encryption Service}
The TPM keeps a secret master key, unique to the machine.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Binding Encryption} encrypts data using the TPM binding key.
    \item \textbf{Sealing Encryption} encrypts data so that it can only be decrypted by a machine with a certain verified configuration.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Functions}
\paragraph{I/O}
All commands enter/exit through the I/O bus, it is the only way to communicate with the TPM functions.
\paragraph{Cryptography Co-Processor}
Processor for encryption functions, it provides utilities such as hashing, RSA encryption and digital signatures
as well as AES encryption.
\paragraph{Key Generation}
Able to create RSA keypairs and generate AES symmetric keys.
\paragraph{HMAC \& SHA-1 Engines}
Provides hardware HMAC and SHA-1 implementations.
\paragraph{Random Number Generator}
Useful for key-generation, nonces and generally as a source of randomness.
\paragraph{Power Detection}
Manages the TPM power state in conjunction with the platform power state.
\paragraph{Execution Engine}
Runs program code to dispatch the received commands.
\paragraph{Non-Volatile Memory}
Used to store TPM parameters in a persistent manner.
\paragraph{Volatile Memory}
Temporary storage for the execution engine, as well as for volatile parameters.
