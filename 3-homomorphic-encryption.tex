\section{Homomorphic Encryption}

Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that allows operations over the encrypted results
as if the operations were done on the original data.

Homomorphic encryption can be categorized over three different methods.

\paragraph{Fully Homomorphic Encryption}
It is considered to be the holy grail of cryptography and while it has been proven to be theoretically possible there has been no progress yet.
FHE supports unlimited additions and multiplications.

\paragraph{Partially Homomorphic Encryption}
PHE supports only one method, either additions or multiplication.

\paragraph{Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption}
SWHE tries to bridge the gap between methods providing both in a limited manner.
